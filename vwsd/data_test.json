Thus sultan al-Mujahid Ali (r. 1322-1363) based taxes on the average of production over several years, and deduced the grain to be sown as seed from the taxable produce. While the state model was taken from the Ayyubid state in Egypt, the Rasulids were more oriented towards trade. The sultans drew much of their income from taxes and customs revenues from the ports. Especially Aden was important as a port where ships going between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean stopped. Textiles, perfume and spices came from India, Southeast Asia and China, while slaves, ivory and pepper were brought from Africa. Among the more important Yemeni items for export were horses and agricultural crops. Jewish merchants could be found in the main ports as well as Indians, Africans and Egyptians. In his travel account, Marco Polo mentions the sultan of Aden (Yemen) in the late thirteenth century: \"\"In his kingdom there are many towns and castles, and it has the advantage of an excellent port, frequented by ships from India arriving with spices and drugs... The sultan of Aden possesses immense treasures, arising from the imposts he lays, as well upon the merchandise that comes from India, as upon that which is shipped in his port as the returning cargo\"\".\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.test.all-00003-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.test.all-00003-of-00005_47_Rasulid dynasty_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Rasulids_Aden_Yemen_1335.jpg"}

ME usage declined after 1973, when Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the United States. There has been renewed interest in the technique, in the 1990s and more recently in the 2010s, due to increased restrictions on abortion. In some countries where abortion is illegal, such as Bangladesh, the terms \u201cmenstrual regulation\u201d or \u201cmenstrual extraction\u201d are used as euphemisms for early pregnancy terminations.", "\"In 1971, members of a feminist reproductive health self-help group, Lorraine Rothman and Carol Downer modified equipment found in an underground abortion clinic that was developed for a new non-traumatic, manually-operated-suction abortion technique. They took the thin, flexible plastic Karman cannula (about the size of a soda straw), and the syringe (50 or 60ml), and added a one-way bypass valve, to fix two main problems. The contraption could prevent air from being pumped into the uterus, and also suctioned uterine contents directly into the syringe, thus limiting the amount that could be removed. They added two lengths of clear plastic tubing, one from the cannula to the collection jar and another to go from the collection jar to the syringe. With this new set-up, the contents of the uterus went directly into the jar, allowing for the extraction of more material, and the two-way bypass valve diverted any air that may have been inadvertently pushed back toward the body to exit harmlessly into the air; this would prevent air from entering the uterus. Rothman and Downer dubbed the new invention the \"\"Del Em.\"\" By making it possible for more than one person to operate the device, the skill level of the operators was greatly reduced. One person could concentrate on guiding the sterile cannula through the vaginal cavity into the cervical os while another could pump the syringe to develop the vacuum.

The scion of the grafted tomato represents the upper portion of the plant and is selected for its fruit quality characteristics. There are several methods for grafting tomatoes and they have certain advantages and disadvantages. Once the grafts are made, the plants are moved into a chamber or environment with high relative humidity and low light levels to reduce water stress in the scion while the graft union forms.", "\"There are a variety of methods for grafting vegetable crops.  Cleft grafting occurs when a V-shape is cut into the rootstock and a complementing wedge-shaped scion is inserted.  The graft is then held with a small clip until healing occurs.  Approach grafting involves notching opposing sides of the stems of the rootstock and scion, and then using a clip to hold the stems together while they fuse.  Once the graft has healed, the original scion is then cut off of the desired rootstock and the unused rootstock is detached from the scion.  Micrografting is a new technique that has been recently integrated into micropropagation production for hybrid tomato.  This method uses micropropagated scion shoots that grafted onto 3 week-old rootstock seedlings. The most common commercial technique for grafting tomato is tube grafting.  Tube grafting takes place when the scion and rootstock are severed as seedlings and reattached with a small, silicone tube or clip.  This technique has been highly effective as it can be carried out when plants are very small, thereby eliminating the need for large healing chambers while increasing the output.  Tube grafting has been adopted as the primary method for vegetable grafting on the farm as it can be easily carried out with small healing chambers with typical success rates ranging from 85 to 90 percent .\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005_209_Tomato grafting_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Cleft_Oda_1999.jpg"}

Many factors can impair fetal memory and its functions, primarily maternal actions. There are multiple techniques available not only to demonstrate the existence of fetal memory but to measure it. Fetal memory is vulnerable to certain diseases so much so that exposure can permanently damage the development of the fetus and even terminate the pregnancy by aborting the fetus. Maternal nutrition and the avoidance of drugs, alcohol and other substances during all nine months of pregnancy is important to the development of the fetus and its memory systems. The use of certain substances can entail long-term permanent effects on the fetus that can carry on throughout their lifespan.", "\"The second paradigm, habituation, is one of the most successful ways of investigating fetal memory. Habituation has been demonstrated in fetuses as early as 22 weeks and corresponds to the onset of fetal auditory abilities. Both auditory and vibroacoustic stimulation have been used in habituation. Vibroacoustic stimulation is a technique involving the repetitive stimulation of the fetus, by applying a vibroacoustic stimulus (in predetermined intervals) to the abdomen of the mother. The movement and reaction of the fetus, in response to the stimulus, is recorded using ultrasound technology. This process is repeated until habituation, defined as a lack of response to the stimulus by the fetus, is reached. Stimulation trials continue into the neonatal period (first 28 days after birth) by presenting the same auditory stimulus, to test whether or not the fetus has memory of the stimulation events. A scientific control group of babies in the neonatal period, having not been exposed to the stimulus as a fetus, are used in neonatal trials to serve as a comparison.\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005_225_Prenatal memory_en.jpg", "url": "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Neonatal_Jacoplane.jpg"}

It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily from the genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a verse\u2013chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.\"", "\"From the late 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. Major artists included Carole King, Cat Stevens and James Taylor. It reached its commercial peak in the mid- to late 1970s with acts like Billy Joel, America and the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose Rumours (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade. In contrast, hard rock was more often derived from blues-rock and was played louder and with more intensity. It often emphasised the electric guitar, both as a rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs and as a solo lead instrument, and was more likely to be used with distortion and other effects. Key acts included British Invasion bands like the Kinks, as well as psychedelic era performers like Cream, Jimi Hendrix and the Jeff Beck Group. Hard rock-influenced bands that enjoyed international success in the later 1970s included Queen, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, AC/DC, and Van Halen.\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005_287_Rock music_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/LedZeppelinChicago75_2.jpg"}

That is, all the genes in offspring will originate from only the mother or only the father. This phenomenon is most commonly observed in eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. This is because such organelles contain their own DNA and are capable of independent mitotic replication that does not endure crossing over with the DNA from another parental type. Although uniparental inheritance is the most common form of inheritance in organelles, there is increased evidence of diversity. Some studies found doubly uniparental inheritance and biparental transmission to exist in cells. Evidence suggests that even when there is biparental inheritance, crossing-over doesn't always occur. Furthermore, there is evidence that the form of organelle inheritance varied frequently over time. Uniparental inheritance can be divided into multiple subtypes based on the pathway of inheritance.", "\"Like all other genetic concepts, the discovery of uniparental inheritance stems from the days of an Augustinian priest known as Gregor Johann Mendel. The soon-to-be \"\"father of modern genetics\"\" spent his days conducting hybridization experiments on pea plants(Pisum sativum) in his monastery's garden. During a period of seven years (1856 to 1863), Mendel cultivated and tested some 29,000 pea plants which led to him deducing the two famous generalizations known as Mendel's Laws of Heredity. The first, the law of segregation, states that \"\"when any individual produces gametes, the copies of a gene separate, so that each gamete receives only one copy\"\". The second, the law of independent assortment, states that \"\"alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation\"\". Although his work was published, it lay dormant until it was rediscovered in 1900 by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns  but it was not until 1909 that non-mendelian inheritance was even suggested. Carl Erich Correns and Erwin Baur, in separately conducted researches on Pelargonium and Mirabilis plants, observed a green-white variation (later found as the result of mutations in the chloroplast genome) that did not follow the Mendelian laws of inheritance. Nearly twenty years later, non-mendelian inheritance of a mitochondrial mutation was also observed and, in the sixties, it was proven that chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own DNA and that they are capable translation, transcription, and replication independent of the nucleus. Soon after, the discoveries of uniparental and doubly uniparental inheritance came.\"\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005_296_Uniparental inheritance_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Carl_Correns.jpg"}

Thus it corresponds to term patriciate in its modern, broad generic sense in English. The patricians did not constitute a legally defined class as such, although its constituent groups, the civil servants and the burghers held various legal privileges, with the clergy de jure forming one of the two privileged estates of the realm until 1814.", "\"In Telemark, the patricians from the early 17th century consisted of two intertwined main groups, the burghers in the Skien area and the civil servants in Upper Telemark which formed a close-knit \"\"aristocracy of officials;\"\" the two groups often intermarried.

Furthermore, the Aall and L\u00f8venskiold families became part of the Telemark patriciate in the 18th century and acquired significant fortunes, partly through intermarriage with the older elite in Telemark.

The species' dramatic decline was the result of habitat loss due to the expansion of ranching and farming in western North America, industrial-scale hunting practiced by non-indigenous hunters, increased indigenous hunting pressure due to non-indigenous demand for bison hides and meat, and cases of deliberate policy by settler governments to destroy the food source of the native Indian peoples during times of conflict.", "\"The modern American bison is split into two subspecies, the wood bison in the boreal forests of what is now Canada, and the plains bison on the prairies extending from Canada to Mexico. The plains subspecies became the dominant animal of the prairies of North America, where bison were a keystone species, whose grazing and trampling pressure was a force that shaped the ecology of the Great Plains as strongly as periodic prairie fires and which were central to the survival of many American Indians of the Great Plains. To the corn-growing village Indians, it was a valued second food source. However, there is now some controversy over their interaction. Charles C. Mann wrote in 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, pages 367 ff, \"\"Hernando De Soto's expedition staggered through the Southeast for four years in the early 16th century and saw hordes of people but apparently didn't see a single bison.\"\" Mann discussed the evidence that Native Americans not only created (by selective use of fire) the large grasslands that provided the bison's ideal habitat but also kept the bison population regulated. In this theory, it was only when the original human population was devastated by wave after wave of epidemic (from diseases of Europeans) after the 16th century that the bison herds propagated wildly. In such a view, the seas of bison herds that stretched to the horizon were a symptom of an ecology out of balance, only rendered possible by decades of heavier-than-average rainfall.  Other evidence of the arrival circa 1550\u20131600 in the savannas of the eastern seaboard includes the lack of places which southeast natives named after buffalo. Bison were the most numerous single species of large wild mammal on Earth.\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.test.all-00004-of-00005_376_Bison hunting_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Tableau_31_Indians_hunting_the_bison_by_Karl_Bodmer.jpg"}

Their existence in cellular membranes remains somewhat controversial. It has been proposed that they are specialized membrane microdomains which compartmentalize cellular processes by serving as organising centers for the assembly of signaling molecules, allowing a closer interaction of protein receptors and their effectors to promote kinetically favorable interactions necessary for the signal transduction. Lipid rafts influence membrane fluidity and membrane protein trafficking, thereby regulating neurotransmission and receptor trafficking. Lipid rafts are more ordered and tightly packed than the surrounding bilayer, but float freely within the membrane bilayer. Although more common in the cell membrane, lipid rafts have also been reported in other parts of the cell, such as the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes.", "Immunoglobulin E (IgE) signaling is the first convincingly demonstrated lipid rafts involving signaling process. Evidence for this fact includes decreased solubility of Fc-epsilon receptors (Fc\u03b5R) in Triton X-100 from steady state to crosslinking state, formation of patches large enough to be visualized by fluorescence microscopy from gangliosides and GPI-anchored proteins, abolition of IgE signaling by surface cholesterol depletion with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and so on. This signaling pathway can be described as follows: IgE first binds to Fc-epsilon receptors (Fc\u03b5R) residing in the plasma membrane of mast cells and basophils through its Fc segment. Fc\u03b5R is a tetramer consist of one \u03b1, one \u03b2 and two \u03b3 chains. It is monomeric and binds one IgE molecule. The \u03b1 chain binds IgE and the other three chains contain immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM). Then oligomeric antigens bind to receptor-bound IgE to crosslink two or more of these receptors. This crosslinking then recruits doubly acylated non-receptor Src-like tyrosine kinase Lyn to phosphorylate ITAMs. After that, Syk family tyrosine kinases bind these phosphotyrosine residues of ITAMs to initiate the signaling cascade. Syk can, in turn, activate other proteins such as LAT. Through crosslinking, LAT can recruit other proteins into the raft and further amplify the signal.\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.test.all-00002-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.test.all-00002-of-00005_536_Lipid raft_en.jpeg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/IgE_signalling_process.jpeg"}

Before the Balkan Wars Macedonist ideas were shared by a limited circle of intellectuals. They grew in significance during the interbellum, both in Vardar Macedonia and among the left-leaning diaspora in Bulgaria, and were endorsed by the Comintern. During the Second World War, these ideas were supported by the Communist Partisans, who founded the Yugoslav Macedonian Republic in 1944. Following the Second World War, Macedonism became the basis of Yugoslav Macedonia's state ideology, aimed at transforming the Slavic and, to a certain extent, non-Slavic parts of its population into ethnic Macedonians. This state policy is still current in today's Republic of North Macedonia, where it was developed in several directions.

While heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing gunships and bombers have been launched from aircraft carriers, it is currently not possible to land them.

The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940, when HMS\u00a0Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes.

A transmission line that is properly terminated, that is, terminated with the same impedance as that of the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, will have no reflections and therefore no mismatch loss. Mismatch loss represents the amount of power wasted in the system. It can also be thought of as the amount of power gained if the system was perfectly matched. Impedance matching is an important part of RF system design; however, in practice there will likely be some degree of mismatch loss. In real systems, relatively little loss is due to mismatch loss and is often on the order of 1dB.", "\"If there are two or more components in cascade as is often the case, the resultant mismatch loss is not only due to the mismatches from the individual components, but also from how the reflections from each component combine with each other.  The overall mismatch loss cannot be calculated by just adding up the individual loss contributions from each component.  The difference between the sum of the mismatch loss in each component and total mismatch loss due to the interactions of the reflections is known as mismatch error.  Depending on how the multiple reflections combine, the overall system loss may be lower or higher than the sum of the mismatch loss from each component.  Mismatch error occurs in pairs as the signal reflects off of each mismatched component.  So for the example in Figure 3, there are mismatch errors generated by each pair of components. The mismatch uncertainty increases as the frequency increases, and in wide-band applications.  The phasing of the reflections makes it particularly harder to model.\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.test.all-00000-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.test.all-00000-of-00005_782_Mismatch loss_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/T_line_img3.jpg"}

[now full species], from Spain, is paler with the distal margin more strongly spotted. \u2014 apennina Z. (81 d) [now full species] is on the whole paler, the dark marginal border of the forewing being lighter in consequence of an intermixture of the ground-colour; from Italy. \u2014 The Greek form graeca  Ruhl-Heyne is quite similar. \u2014 rezniceki Bartel, from Northern Italy, is a transition to the previous; according to the description the upperside of the males is still paler. \u2014 albicans H.-Schiff. (81 d) [now full species] is the lightest form, which is almost white above; it flies on limestone in Spain, sometimes as the only form, sometimes in the company of hispana (Ribbe). \u2014 caucasica Led. (= ossmar Gerh.) [now full species] (81 e) extends on to the Asiatic continent, flying in Armenia and at the Black Sea. The upperside of the male is brighter blue. \u2014 In specimens from the Taurus Mts. even a slight violet sheen is present, especially in the outer area of the wings; this is corydonius H.-Schiff. (= olympica Led.) (81 d).[now full species Lysandra corydonius (Lederer, 1870)] \u2014 The blue colour of the male may occasionally appear also in the female, being sometimes restricted to the base \u2014 ab. semibrunnea Mill. (= semi-syngrapha Tutt) \u2014 sometimes occupying the whole upperside: ab. syngrapha Kef. (= mariscolore Gerh.)(81 d). On the other hand the blue upperside of the male may dulled by a grey suffusion: ab. suffusa Tutt. Other accidental forms are males with red spots at the margin above: ab. suavis Schultz, and females with such spots: ab. aurantia Tutt. In ab. inaequalis Tutt the glossy blue colour forms irregular streaks on a dark ground. In ab. marginata Tutt the black margin is broadened. In ab. fowleri South the margin is white instead of black, while in ab. punctata Tutt the margins are spotted. ab. calydonius Lowe has the ground colour darkened and the black borders enlarged. \u2014 Equally variable as the upperside is the under surface. The ground-colour beneath may be very dark (especially in certain females) or remarkably pale; the latter is the case in ab. pallida Tutt. The ocelli may be distorted into rays: ab. striata Tutt. Some of the ocelli may be united: ab. tiphys Esp. They may be increased in number: ab. luxurians Courv., or they may be reduced (ab. privata, unipuncta, impuncta) or all be absent: ab. cinnus Hbn. (= sohni Ruhl) (81 d). Moreover, all these variations may be more or less slightly developed or vestigial (ab. semiaurantia, caeruleomarginataetc.), or various aberrational characters may be combined in one individual, as for instance in ab. parisiensis Gerh., which is an ab. syngrapha with the ocelli as in ab. tiphys, etc. \u2014 Egg greenish\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.test.all-00001-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.test.all-00001-of-00005_967_Chalkhill blue_en.JPG", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Polyommatus_coridon_female_in_Dourbes_Viroin_Valley%2C_Belgium..JPG"}

It is one of the largest of all monkeys. Located primarily in southern Africa, the chacma baboon has a wide variety of social behaviors, including a dominance hierarchy, collective foraging, adoption of young by females, and friendship pairings. These behaviors form parts of a complex evolutionary ecology. In general, the species is not threatened, but human population pressure has increased contact between humans and baboons. Hunting, trapping, and accidents kill or remove many baboons from the wild, thereby reducing baboon numbers and disrupting their social structure.", "\"The chacma baboon is perhaps the longest species of monkey, with a male body length of 50\u2013115\u00a0cm (20\u201345\u00a0in) and tail length of 45\u201384\u00a0cm (18\u201333\u00a0in). It also one of the heaviest; the male weighs from 21 to 45\u00a0kg (46 to 99\u00a0lb) with an average of 31.8\u00a0kg (70\u00a0lb). Baboons are sexually dimorphic, and females are considerably smaller than males. The female chacma weighs from 12 to 25\u00a0kg (26 to 55\u00a0lb), with an average of 15.4\u00a0kg (34\u00a0lb). It is similar in size to the olive baboon, averaging slightly higher in mean body mass, and of similar weight to the more compact mandrill, the males of which weigh on average about 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb) more than a chacma baboon, the females weigh 3\u00a0kg (6.6\u00a0lb) less than the female chacma. While the mandrill is usually crowned the largest of all modern monkeys, going on total length and average (but not maximum) body weight between the sexes, the chacma baboon appears to be the largest extant monkey. The chacma baboon is generally dark brown to gray in color, with a patch of rough hair on the nape of its neck. Unlike the males of northern baboon species (the Guinea, hamadryas, and olive baboons), chacma males do not have a mane. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this baboon is its long, downward-sloping face. The canine teeth of male chacma baboons have a mean length of 3.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\u00a0cm (1.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0in) at the time they emigrate from their natal troop.
