Demonstration is a way to illustrate activities such as historical craft-making and concepts like scientific principles. It is also a way to contextualize a museum object or artifact. In a demonstration, the demonstrator generally explains the activity or concept using something \"\"real\"\" like an object or animal. In traditional demonstrations, the demonstrators generally do not assume to be anyone else (characterization might be involved in more theatrical demonstrations). One example of a demonstration is fish feeding at the New England Aquarium, in which visitors watch a diver feed fish while listening to a volunteer explain the process. Another example is the lightning presentation at the Museum of Science, Boston during which visitors watch lightning flashes produced by a Van de Graaff generator. There is a great deal of overlap between demonstration and theatre. Theatrical techniques such as characterization, costume, narrative, and special effects are often used to enliven demonstration and draw visitor attention. Some museums, such as Science Museum in London, classify demonstration as a form of museum theatre, while other museums, such as the Science Museum of Minnesota, use actors to present demonstrations. Demonstration may also serve as a component of a museum play or theatre piece. However, differences remain between the conventions of demonstration and the conventions of theatre. In her book Exploring Museum Theatre, Tessa Bridal warns museums against promoting a demonstration as a theatre performance, as it may cause visitor confusion or disappointment. Yet like museum theatre and other forms of live interpretation, demonstration aims to engage visitors, to create interest in a topic, to serve as an alternative to lists of facts and static exhibitions, and to provoke an emotional response that leads to learning.\"\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.val.all-00000-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.val.all-00000-of-00005_41_Museum theatre_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Conner-prairie-pottery.jpg"}

The enzyme causes negative supercoiling of the DNA or relaxes positive supercoils. It does so by looping the template so as to form a crossing, then cutting one of the double helices and passing the other through it before releasing the break, changing the linking number by two in each enzymatic step. This process occurs in bacteria, whose single circular DNA is cut by DNA gyrase and the two ends are then twisted around each other to form supercoils. Gyrase is also found in eukaryotic plastids: it has been found in the apicoplast of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum and in chloroplasts of several plants. Bacterial DNA gyrase is the target of many antibiotics, including nalidixic acid, novobiocin, and ciprofloxacin.", "\"A single molecule study has characterized gyrase activity as a function of DNA tension (applied force) and ATP, and proposed a mechanochemical model. Upon binding to DNA (the \"\"Gyrase-DNA\"\" state), there is a competition between DNA wrapping and dissociation, where increasing DNA tension increases the probability of dissociation. According to the catalytic cycle proposed, binding of 2 ATP molecules causes dimerization of ATPase domains of GyrB subunits and capturing of a T-segment of DNA (T- from transferring) in a cavity between GyrB subunits. On a next step the enzyme cleaves a G-segment of DNA (G- from gate) making a double-strand break. Then the T-segment is transferred through the break, which is accompanied by the hydrolysis of the first ATP molecule. DNA-gyrase ligates the break in a G-segment back and T-segment finally leaves the enzyme complex.

In a courtroom, it means steps to promote transparency such as letting the public see and hear trials as they happen in real time, televising trials as they happen, videotaping proceedings for later viewing, publishing the content and documents of court files, providing transcripts of statements, making past decisions available for review in an easy-to-access format, publishing decisions, and giving reporters full access to files and participants so they can report what happens.

The rise of social media websites such as Facebook has opened new ways for court cases to be made public; for example, in Australia, courts have considered having websites with live videos as well as blogs by retired judges to \"\"preserve the concepts of open justice\"\" in the digital age. In recent years, when governments try to cope with thorny problems such as terrorism, there are concerns that the principle of open justice can be undermined relatively easily by national security concerns.

It considers both liberty and equality to be compatible and mutually dependent on each other. Liberal socialism is a type of socialism that has been most prominent in the post-war period. For Ian Adams, post-war social democracy and socialist New Labour are examples of liberal socialism, in contrast to classical socialism.

Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are \"\"landlocked\"\", spending their entire lives in freshwater. Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, S. salar is iteroparous, which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to have a go at it again in another year -such individuals can grow to extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English: alevin, fry, parr and smolt.\"", "\"The IUCN rates this as a common species with a conservation status of \"\"least concern\"\".

This pneuma, which is the active part or reason of God, provides form and motion to matter, and is the origin of the elements, life, and human rationality.

But the mind is no mere passive recipient of impressions: the mind assents or dissents. The contents of experience are not all true or valid: hallucination is possible; here the Stoics agreed with the Epicureans.

The results of the studies found labeling profoundly affected the children\u2019s liking towards toys, and the other study showed that girls are more affected than boys in terms of labeling. The \u201ccolor pink did seem to give girls permission to explore masculine toys. This indicates that pink may signify that it is allowable for girls to show interest in counter-stereotypic toys and activities\u201d. This gender specific marketing/labeling exposes children to gender roles and that color can be an indicator of gender. \u00a0Children \u201cshow less involvement with toys stereotypically associated with the opposite sex, and they reject such toys more than ones stereotypically associated with their own sex or neutral ones\u201d. Toys are a medium for children to form gender stereotypes. Some toys, like stuffed animals, have proven to be gender-neutral and are usually marketed to both boys and girls. Parents also play a large role in building their children's gender socialization, as they are the ones buying the toys for their children. The popularity of making toy advertising gender neutral has been increasing through media such as ads showing boys playing with baby dolls (a toy that has commonly been marketed only towards girls in the past). At a young age for both boys and girls start to identify themselves by their gender role and are limited to what they can or can't do. Not just that, but the environment around young boys and girls also influences their behavior.\"\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.val.all-00004-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.val.all-00004-of-00005_658_Gender neutrality_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/%E2%80%98Libertad_para_jugar%E2%80%99%2C_la_campa%C3%B1a_municipal_a_favor_de_los_juguetes_no_sexistas_01.jpg"}

From 1885 to 1908, millions died as a result of murder, deprivation, and disease, with population falling by millions in this period; some writers estimate this loss to be as high as 10 million people.", "\"In 1885, Leopold II established the Congo Free State under the auspices of the International Association of the Congo, by securing the European community's agreement with the claim that he was involved in humanitarian and philanthropic work. To monopolize the resources of the entire Congo Free State, Leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that stripped control of resources from the native populations and required them to work. Collectively, these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber, harvested or found, to state officers or to the state's monopoly concession companies, thus nearly completing Leopold's monopoly of the Congo's ivory and rubber trade. The rubber came from wild vines in the jungle, unlike the rubber from Brazil (Hevea brasiliensis), which was tapped from trees. To extract the rubber, instead of tapping the vines, the Congolese workers would slash them and lather their bodies with the rubber latex. When the latex hardened, it would be scraped off the skin in a painful manner, as it took off the worker's hair with it. The Force Publique, the Free State's military, was used to enforce the rubber quotas. During the 1890s, the Force Publique's primary role was to enforce a system of corv\u00e9e labour to promote the rubber trade. Armed with modern weapons and the chicotte\u2014a bull whip made of hippopotamus hide\u2014the Force Publique routinely took and tortured hostages, slaughtered families of rebels, and flogged and raped Congolese people. Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death.

In Navajo culture, the pictographs are credited to people who lived before the flood. The Fremont River itself is named for John Charles Fr\u00e9mont, an American explorer. It inhabited sites in what is now Utah and parts of Nevada, Idaho and Colorado from AD 1 to 1301. It was adjacent to, roughly contemporaneous with, but distinctly different from the Ancestral Pueblo peoples located to their south.", "\"Scholars do not agree that the Fremont culture represents a single, cohesive group with a common language, ancestry, or way of life, but several aspects of their material culture provides evidence for this concept. First, Fremont culture people foraged wild food sources and grew corn. The culture participated in a continuum of fairly reliable subsistence strategies that no doubt varied from place to place and time to time. This shows up in the archaeological record at most village sites and long term camps as a collection of butchered, cooked and then discarded bone from mostly deer and rabbits, charred corn cobs with the kernels removed, and wild edible plant remains. Other unifying characteristics include the manufacture of relatively expedient gray ware pottery and a signature style of basketry and rock art. Most of the Fremont lived in small single and extended family units comprising villages ranging from two to a dozen pithouse structures, with only a few having been occupied at any one time. Still, exceptions to this rule exist (partly why the Fremont have earned a reputation for being so hard to define), including an unusually large village in the Parowan Valley of southwestern Utah, the large and extensively excavated village of Five Finger Ridge at the above mentioned Fremont Indian State Park, and others, all appearing to be anomalous in that they were either occupied for a long period of time, were simultaneously occupied by a large number of people, 60 or more at any given moment, or both. The Fremont are sometimes thought to have begun as a splinter group of the Ancestral Pueblo people, although archaeologists do not agree on this theory.\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.val.all-00004-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.val.all-00004-of-00005_731_Fremont culture_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Southern_San_Rafael_Fremont_Indian_petroglyphs_%28~400_to_~1350_A.D.%29_%28Capitol_Reef_National_Park%2C_southern_Utah%2C_USA%29_2_%2822899336311%29.jpg"}

They are transient features of the solar surface, forming and dissipating over periods of seconds to days. They form the basic structure of the lower corona and transition region of the Sun. These highly structured loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar magnetic flux within the solar body. Coronal loops are associated with sunspots; the two \"\"footpoints\"\" where the loop passes through the sun's surface are often sunspots. This is because sunspots occur at regions of high magnetic field. The high magnetic field where the loop passes through the surface forms a barrier to convection currents, which bring hot plasma from the interior to the sun's surface, so the plasma in these high field regions is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, appearing as a dark spot when viewed against the rest of the photosphere.\"", "\"A closed loop of magnetic field, a flux tube above the solar surface, does not by itself constitute a coronal loop; it must be filled with plasma before it can be called a coronal loop. With this in mind, it becomes clear that coronal loops are a rarity on the solar surface, as the majority of closed-flux structures are empty. This means the mechanism that heats the corona and injects chromospheric plasma into the closed magnetic flux is highly localised. The mechanism behind plasma filling, dynamic flows and coronal heating remains a mystery. The mechanism(s) must be stable enough to continue to feed the corona with chromospheric plasma and powerful enough to accelerate and therefore heat the plasma from 6000\u00a0K to well over 1\u00a0MK over the short distance from the chromosphere and transition region to the corona. This is the very reason coronal loops are targeted for intense study.

Although submerged under Lake Oconee, the site is still important as one of the first explorations of a large Mississippian culture mound. The Dyar site is thought to have been one of the principal towns of the paramount chiefdom of Ocute, perhaps Cofaqui.", "Platform mounds are built up in a series of stages that can span generations. The Dyar mound itself began during the Stillhouse Phase with a large civic structure with a sand floor and built with single set post construction. Over this a layer of 70 centimetres (28\u00a0in) thick blue-black clay was added. On top of this was added a 40 centimetres (16\u00a0in) layer of grey clay loam and on which another structure was added. Stillhouse Phase Etowah Complicated stamped pottery sherds were found at this layer. Stage II begins with another layer of 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in) grey clay loam added. Stages III, IV, V, and VI are in sequence 35 centimetres (14\u00a0in) of dark and then white clay, 45 centimetres (18\u00a0in) red and grey clay, 70 centimetres (28\u00a0in) of grey and tan clay, and 37 centimetres (15\u00a0in) of dark grey and reddish tan clay, each stage with its own structure. Stage VII consists of 25 centimetres (9.8\u00a0in) of grey and orange and 25 centimetres (9.8\u00a0in) of yellow clay. A step up on the western side of the summit indicates that this stage was the first to have multiple levels and multiple structures, possibly two large structures on the western side and a smaller one on the eastern side which was found to have had a burned floor. Stage VIII was a layer of brown clay 14 centimetres (5.5\u00a0in)to 20 centimetres (7.9\u00a0in) thick. The eastern side at this stage is 40 centimetres (16\u00a0in) lower than the western side and covered by a layer of construction debris though to have come from the razing of an old structure on the western side. Stage IX is 80 centimetres (31\u00a0in) of brown and grey clay with the multiple levels continuing. Pottery sherds from this layer are thought to date from the Duvall Phase. Stage X is a thin 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in) layer of light grey clay followed by Stage XI which is another thick 57 centimetres (22\u00a0in) layer of gray and tan clay. Stage XI is thought to date from the Ironhorse Phase. All stages above this date to the Ironhorse and Dyar Phases. Stage XII is a 60 centimetres (24\u00a0in) layer of yellow and grey clay. The structure at the western side has a semi-subterranean floor cut into its surface, the first seen on the mound. At this stage the difference between the eastern and western levels is 40 centimetres (16\u00a0in) to 50 centimetres (20\u00a0in).

The firefly squid is a predator and actively hunts its food, which includes copepods, small fish, and other squids. The lifespan of a firefly squid is about one year. At the end of their lives females return close to shore to release their eggs, then die shortly thereafter.

The Indian wolf travels in smaller packs and is less vocal than other variants of the grey wolf, and has a reputation for being cunning.\"", "\"The Indian wolf is similar in structure to the European wolf, but is smaller, more slightly built, and has shorter fur with little to no underfur. It is typically around 57\u201372\u00a0cm (22\u201328\u00a0in) at shoulder height, with males ranging from 19\u201325\u00a0kg (42-55\u00a0lb) and females 17\u201322\u00a0kg (37-49\u00a0lb) in weight. Its length ranges from 103\u2013145\u00a0cm (41\u201357\u00a0in) from nose to tail. Like the Arabian wolf, it has short, thin fur in summer, though the hair on the back remains long even in summer, an adaptation thought to be against solar radiation. The fur is generally greyish-red to reddish-white with grey tones. The hairs are grizzled with black, particularly on the back, which sports a dark V-shaped patch around the shoulders. The limbs are paler than the body, and the underparts are almost completely white. Pups are born sooty-brown, with a milk-white patch on the chest that fades with age. Black specimens are rare, but have been recorded in India's Solapur district and two regions of Iran. In the latter country, the mutation was found to be naturally occurring, unlike in North American grey wolves, which have inherited the K\u1d47 allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs.\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.val.all-00004-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.val.all-00004-of-00005_825_Indian wolf_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Indian_Wolf_Pack_at_Blackbuck_National_Park%2C_Gujarat%2C_India.jpg"}

Its modern form is derived from the design philosophy Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED), which aims to prevent crime or protect property through three strategies: natural surveillance, natural access control, and territorial enforcement.\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.val.all-00002-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.val.all-00002-of-00005_899_Hostile architecture_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Flint_anti_urination_device%2C_St_Gregory%27s%2C_Norwich.jpg"}

In some senses, adding an entrainer is similar to extractive distillation.\n"], "folder_name": "wit_v1.val.all-00002-of-00005", "language": "en", "image_path": "wit_v1.val.all-00002-of-00005_948_Azeotropic distillation_en.jpg", "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Common_equipment_used_in_Azeotropic_Distillation.jpg"}

Also, E. annectens is also from the Laramie Formation, and magnetostratigraphy suggests an age of 69-68 Ma for the Laramie Formation. Edmontosaurus annectens is known from numerous specimens, including at least twenty partial to complete skulls, discovered in the U.S. states of Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado and the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It was a large animal, up to approximately 12 metres, potentially up to 15 m in length, with an extremely long and low skull.

Campione and Evans interpreted these results as strongly suggesting that the shape of Edmontosaurus skulls changed dramatically as they grew. This has led to several apparent mistakes in classification in the past. The three previously recognized Maastrichtian edmontosaur species likely represent growth stages of a single species, with E. saskatchewanensis representing juveniles, E. annectens subadults, and Anatotitan copei fully mature adults.

Unlike with penny-farthings, the rider's feet were within reach of the ground, making it easier to stop. The pedals powered the rear wheel, keeping the rider's feet safely away from the front wheel. The original treadle bicycle model used treadles to transfer power to the rear wheel, while the later 1879 model used a chain drive, an important new technology that had previously only been used on tricycles. Lawson's safety failed to catch on, perhaps because of its increased cost, weight and complexity compared to the penny-farthing.
